# Generating Docs

The Grasshopper documentation is built with [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). 
Mkdocs is a simple way to use markdown to build docs.

To add to the docs you have to:

1. Install mkdocs: `pip install mkdocs` (You will need python and pip. Pip can be installed with `sudo easy_install pip`)
1. `mkdocs server`
1. Open http://localhost:3008
1. Start editing the files in the `docs/` dir and `mkdocs.yml` in the project root.
