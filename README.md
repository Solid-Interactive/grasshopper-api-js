# What am I?

Grasshopper is the internal code word for our CMS product. We build this system in 2005 and have used it on hundreds
of websites. In an effort to bring this code up to date we are porting it from a relational database and code written
in C# to a document database written in Node. This project is a definition for the API methods that will interface
with the no-sql databases. In theory we can create a variety of backend api's in many languages as long as they
implement the same methods.

# Why would you want to use me?

We conistantly get requested to make mobile applications or quick websites. Many times the existing open source cms
products do not cut it. Our cms is different as it is truely more of a data management tool than a website creator.
This distinction makes it very appealing when creating apis or non-traditional websites that need a tool to easily edit
data.
